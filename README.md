A collection of sripts and update files for collection, cleaning, filtering and distributing open source threat feed data.

Introduction.
I recently found that trying to put together various threat feeds for usage in Splunk.
There are currently some great apps in Splunk that consume open source Threat Feeds for lookups and such but there are far more that we wanted to make use of.

This repo aims to collect, filter and clean the various threat feeds and make the resultant files available for download. We will also be releasing the scripts so that you can customise to your needs.

To start the collection I am including part of the NVD CVE JSON data.


AS this project has just started, there will be a few teething issues while sorting out the Github uploads.
